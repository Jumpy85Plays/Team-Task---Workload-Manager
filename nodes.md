Developers fix comment:

Php was not letting me create the project initially until i manually uncommented "extension_dir = "ext"" and "extension=openssl" in the php.ini of my php installation and the xampp one for apache.

FIXED Having some problems in trying to actually use the migration function in laravel. 
had to manually rename some files as the order i generated them broke some dependancies.
